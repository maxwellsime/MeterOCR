# Meter OCR

Python project to read numbers automatically from a picture of a meter. While this project is less important in the world of IoT, there was only 34.8million smart meters<sup>[1]</sup> (61% of all meters) in Great Britain in 2023. This means 39% of energy clients have to manually update energy companies on a regular basis enabling potential faults in data collected.

### Objective
To Create an automatic process using CSV and Tesseract to gather data from an image of a traditional energy meter.
